            <li>Container Selection:
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a large container with good drainage. Tulsi plants can be grown in pots or containers on your terrace.

                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Soil::
                <ul>
                    <li>Use well-draining potting mix with a slightly acidic to neutral pH.

                    </li>
                    <li> Incorporate organic matter like compost for added fertility.

                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Seedlings or Seeds:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can start Tulsi from seeds or purchase seedlings from a nursery.

                    </li>
                    <li> Sow seeds or transplant seedlings into the container, spacing them appropriately.

                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Sunlight::
                <ul>
                    <li> Tulsi prefers full sunlight. Position the container in a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily
                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>
             <li>Watering:

                    <li>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.

                    </li>
                    <li>Water when the top inch of soil feels dry. Tulsi doesn't like to dry out completely.

                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fertilize every 2-4 weeks during the growing season

                </ul>
             </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.
                    </li>
            
                </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li> Pinch off the tips regularly to promote branching.
