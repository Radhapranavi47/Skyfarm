            <li>Container Selection:
                <ul>
                    <li> Choose large containers with drainage holes to ensure proper drainage and prevent waterlogging.</li>
                    <li> Select containers that are at least 5 gallons in size to provide enough space for the tomato plant's roots.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Soil:
                <ul>
                    <li> Use a well-draining potting mix rich in organic matter.</li>
                    <li>Consider adding perlite or vermiculite to improve aeration.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Sunlight:
                <ul>
                    <li>Tomatoes thrive in full sunlight, so choose a sunny spot on your terrace. </li>
                    <li>Ensure the plants receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Watering:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. </li>
                    <li>Water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch</li>
                    <li>Use a saucer under the container to catch excess water and prevent staining.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Support:
                <ul>
                    <li> Tomato plants may need support as they grow. Use stakes or cages to provide support and keep the plants upright.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Fertilization:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fertilize the plants regularly with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer according to package instructions.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Pruning:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove suckers (side shoots) to encourage the main stem's growth and improve air circulation.</li>
                    <li>Prune as needed to control the size and shape of the plant.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Pest and Disease Control:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep an eye out for pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and caterpillars</li>
                    <li>Use organic or chemical pesticides as necessary, and inspect plants regularly for signs of disease</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Mulching:
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to conserve moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weeds.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Harvesting:
