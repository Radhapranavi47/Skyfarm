            <li>Container Selection:
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose containers that are at least 6-8 inches deep.
                        
                     </li>
                    <li>Onions have shallow roots, so you can plant them in relatively shallow containers.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Soil:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use well-draining potting mix with good fertility.</li>
                    <li>Onions prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil.
                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Sunlight:
                <ul>
                    <li>Position the containers in a location that receives full sunlight.
                    </li>
                    <li>Onions prefer at least 6 hours of sunlight per day</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Watering:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the soil consistently moist, especially during dry periods.</li>
                    <li>Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, but avoid overwatering, as onions don't like waterlogged soil.
                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Onion Sets or Seeds:
                <ul>
                    <li>Onions can be grown from sets (small bulbs) or seeds.
                    </li>
                    <li>If using sets, plant them about 1-2 inches deep. If using seeds, follow the seed packet instructions.

                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Spacing:
                <ul>
                    <li> Space onion sets or seedlings at least 4-6 inches apart to allow room for bulb development.
                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Mulching:
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the onion plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.
                </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Pest and Disease Control:
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch for pests like onion thrips and onion maggots.
                    </li>
                    <li>Apply organic or chemical pesticides as needed and inspect plants regularly for signs of disease.
                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Fertilization:
                <ul>
                    <li>Onions benefit from a balanced fertilizer. Apply a general-purpose fertilizer according to package instructions.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Harvesting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Onions can be harvested when the tops begin to yellow and fall over. Once this happens, stop watering to allow the onions to cure.</li>
                    <li>After curing for a few days, you can gently lift the onions from the soil.

                    </li>
                </ul>
             </li>
