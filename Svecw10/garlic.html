        <ol>
            <li>Container Selection:
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose containers with good drainage to prevent waterlogging.</li>
                    <li>Each garlic bulb should be planted individually, so select containers with sufficient space</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Soil:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use well-draining, fertile soil with a neutral pH.</li>
                    <li>Garlic prefers a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Sunlight:
                <ul>
                    <li>CGarlic prefers full sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day.</li>
                    <li>Place containers in a location with ample sunlight exposure.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Watering:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged </li>
                    <li>Reduce watering as the garlic matures and the foliage begins to die back.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Harvesting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Harvest garlic when the lower leaves turn yellow and begin to dry out.</li>
                    <li>Lift the bulbs carefully, avoiding bruising or damage.</li>
                    <li>Allow the bulbs to cure in a dry, shaded area for a few weeks before storage</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Scapes Removal:
                <ul>
                    <li>Garlic plants produce scapes (flower stalks). Removing them encourages the plant to focus energy on bulb development</li>
                    <li>Use the scapes in cooking for added flavor.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Companion Planting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plant garlic near other crops as a natural pest deterrent.</li>
                    <li>It can help repel pests like aphids and certain fungi.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Overwintering:
                <ul>
                    <li>In cold climates, protect garlic containers from severe frost by moving them to a sheltered location or insulating them./li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Fertilization:
                <ul>
                    <li>Side-dress with a balanced fertilizer when the garlic plants are actively growing.</li>
                    <li>Avoid excessive nitrogen as it can encourage more leafy growth at the expense of bulb development.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Varieties:
                <ul>
                    <li>Experiment with different garlic varieties to discover flavors and adaptability to your climate.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
