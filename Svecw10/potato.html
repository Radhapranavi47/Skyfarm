            <li>Container Selection:
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose large, deep containers with good drainage. Potatoes require space for their tubers to develop</li>
                    <li>You can use containers such as grow bags, large pots, or even repurposed containers like barrels.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Potato Variety:
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a potato variety suitable for container gardening. Some compact or small-sized varieties work well in containers.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Sunlight:
                <ul>
                    <li>Position the containers in a location that receives full sunlight.</li>
                    <li>Potatoes prefer at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Watering:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged </li>
                    <li>Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, and avoid allowing the soil to dry out completely.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Support:
                <ul>
                    <li> Tomato plants may need support as they grow. Use stakes or cages to provide support and keep the plants upright.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Hilling:
                <ul>
                    <li>As the potato plants grow, mound soil or add more potting mix around the base to cover the lower stems. This encourages tuber formation and prevents them from being exposed to sunlight.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Chitting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Chitting involves allowing potato tubers to sprout before planting. Place the potatoes in a cool, dark place for a few weeks to encourage sprouting.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Pest and Disease Control:
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch for pests like aphids and Colorado potato beetles.</li>
                    <li>Apply organic or chemical pesticides as needed and inspect plants regularly for signs of disease. </li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Fertilization:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season, following package instructions.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>

             <li>Harvesting:
                <ul>
                    <li>Harvest potatoes when the plants flower and the foliage begins to yellow and die back</li>
                    <li>Carefully dig around the container to harvest the potatoes without damaging them.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
